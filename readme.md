I have moved development to the DnD Royale project. I've updated the technologies and cleaned up a lot of the extraneous files. Please see that project for the newest features.
## Webserver
This is the webserver files for the D&D encounter simulator. It is currenly only hosted on request as it's still in development.
This is my first webapp, also first time working with Python, and deploying my own code.
I'm currently using Flask and deploying the app to Azure.

I grabbed the code initially from 
https://github.com/matteoferla/DnD-encounter-simulator-site
who was the originator.
I have added some functionality and am creating a list of new functionality that I would like to also add, the biggest impact (and one that I'm looking forward to) will be of adding spells to some degree.

If you were looking for the python module to similate locally all the encouner you fancy, then you need to check out the [DnD encounter similator  GitHub repository](https://github.com/matteoferla/DnD-battler).
